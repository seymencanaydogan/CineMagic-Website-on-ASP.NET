# 🎬 CineMagic – Cinema Information Website (ASP.NET)

**CineMagic** is a demo ASP.NET web application that showcases a cinema-style website with key features like movie browsing, showtimes, and user interaction. The project includes source code hosted on GitHub as well as a demo video that highlights how the application works in action.

## 🧩 Overview

CineMagic is designed as a **movie theatre web application** built using **ASP.NET** and related technologies. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how a full-stack web solution can be implemented with features commonly seen in cinema ticketing systems — such as browsing movies, viewing details, and interacting with content.

Although this repository doesn’t currently include an extensive written description, the demo video shows how different parts of the system behave and gives a real-world feel for the user experience.

## 🛠️ Features (Typical for this Kind of Project)

> ✨ *Note: Exact features depend on your implementation in the repository.*

Generally, cinema booking or movie showcase web apps include:

* **Movie Listings** – Users can browse movies by title, genre, or release date.
* **Movie Details** – Each movie has its own page with summaries, images, and metadata.
* **Showtimes & Schedules** – Lists of showtimes for upcoming sessions.
* **Search Functionality** – Users can search for movies quickly.
* **User Authentication** – Login or registration feature for personalized access (optional).
* **Admin Dashboard** – Backend area for managing movies, schedules, and data (optional).

These are common patterns seen in ASP.NET cinema projects (e.g., browsing movies & ticket booking systems seen in similar repos).([GitHub][1])
